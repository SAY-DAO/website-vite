# My React Redux App (MUI) â€” yarn, no auth

## Setup

1. Copy files into a folder `my-react-app`.
2. Install dependencies: `yarn`.
3. Create `.env` from `.env.example` and set `VITE_API_BASE` if needed.
4. Run dev server: `yarn dev`.

## Notes

- Authentication code was removed per your request.
- The axios client does not attach Authorization headers.
- RTL support is enabled (document.dir = 'rtl').
- Place your `img/` folder into `public/img/` so path references from the original HTML keep working.
